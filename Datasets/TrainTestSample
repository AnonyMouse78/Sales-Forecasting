train.csv:

Purpose: This dataset is typically used for training predictive models.
Key Points:
Each row represents the sales of a specific item in a particular store on a given date.
Used for training various forecasting models, including time series and regression.

test.csv:

Purpose: This dataset is usually used for testing the performance of trained models.
Key Points:
Predictions are made for this period using trained models to evaluate their forecasting accuracy.
Helps assess how well the models generalize to new, unseen data.

sample_submission.csv:

Purpose: This dataset serves as a template or format for submitting predictions.
Key Points:
Predictions made on the test dataset are often formatted to match this structure for submission in competitions or evaluation.
Ensures predictions are organized correctly for evaluation and comparison.

These datasets collectively form the basis for training, testing, and evaluating predictive models to 
forecast sales using various quantitative methods like time series analysis and regression. 
The train.csv data is used to train the models, test.csv is used to assess their performance, 
and sample_submission.csv provides the expected format for submitting predictions.
